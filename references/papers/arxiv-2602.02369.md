Prompt: Base Agent Prediction

You are tasked with predicting the probabil-
ity of different outcomes for the following
event:
Event: Which professional football team,
Cincinnati or Pittsburgh, will win the game
scheduled for Oct 16, 2025?
Possible outcomes: “Cincinnati”, “Pitts-
burgh”
Task-Specific Guideline
 • Incorporate dynamic, up-to-date infor-
   mation close to the game date, including
   granular injury reports (e.g., Trey Hen-
   drickson status).
 • Avoid over-reliance on early betting
   odds or historical reputation.
 • Explicitly model and quantify the im-
   pact of key player absences and home-
   field advantage.
CRITICAL: How to Properly Use This
Guideline
1. Verify Applicability: Assess if the cur-
   rent task matches the context of the les-
   son.
2. Trust Your Current Research: If fresh
   findings contradict the guideline, priori-
   tize fresh evidence.

Your task:
 1. Research this event by searching for
    relevant information online.
 2. Analyze the information to assess the
    likelihood of each outcome.
 3. Provide a probability estimate (be-
    tween 0 and 1).
Output as JSON.
