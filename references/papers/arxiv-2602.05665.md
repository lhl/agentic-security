Fig. 5: Overview of agent memory extraction. This figure illustrates a unified pipeline of agent memory construction from
various data resources. Raw inputs, originating from both experience and knowledge memory, are transformed into structured
and compact representations through specialized extraction techniques. These extracted units are then organized into distinct
functional memory types, enabling agents to support reasoning and downstream tasks.

  3) Graph Memory Quality: To systematically evaluate graph-
based memory in agent systems, it is necessary to assess both
the quality of memory retrieval and the structural properties
induced by the graph formulation, as well as their impact on
downstream task performance. We summarize representative
evaluation criteria along three complementary dimensions.
      a) Retrieval Effectiveness: Retrieval quality measures the
ability of the memory graph to surface relevant information
in response to a query. Common metrics include Precision@K
and Recall@K, which quantify relevance among the top-ranked
retrieved nodes, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), which
captures the ranking position of the first relevant memory.
     b) Graph Structural Quality: Graph quality metrics
evaluate whether the constructed memory graph provides
a coherent and faithful representation of stored knowledge.
Typical criteria include coherence, which reflects structural
consistency and connectivity; completeness, which measures
coverage of salient information; redundancy, which captures
unnecessary duplication; and temporal consistency, which
assesses whether temporal relations are correctly preserved.
     c) Task-level Utility: Task performance metrics evaluate
the functional usefulness of graph memory in agent decision-
making, including task success rate, interaction efficiency, and
generalization to unseen tasks or domains.
