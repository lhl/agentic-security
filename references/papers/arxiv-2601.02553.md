stages. All prompts are designed to be model-agnostic but were optimized for GPT-4o-mini in our experiments to ensure
cognitive economy.

A.1. Stage 1: Semantic Structured Compression Prompt
This prompt performs entropy-aware filtering and context normalization. Its goal is to transform raw dialogue windows into
compact, context-independent memory units while excluding low-information interaction content.
                           Listing 1. Prompt for Semantic Structured Compression and Normalization.
You are a memory encoder in a long-term memory system. Your task is to transform raw
    conversational input into compact, self-contained memory units.

INPUT METADATA:
Window Start Time: {window_start_time} (ISO 8601)
Participants: {speakers_list}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Information Filtering:
   - Discard social filler, acknowledgements, and conversational routines that introduce
       no new factual or semantic information.
   - Discard redundant confirmations unless they modify or finalize a decision.
   - If no informative content is present, output an empty list.

2. Context Normalization:
   - Resolve all pronouns and implicit references into explicit entity names.
   - Ensure each memory unit is interpretable without access to prior dialogue.

3. Temporal Normalization:
   - Convert relative temporal expressions (e.g., "tomorrow", "last week") into absolute
       ISO 8601 timestamps using the window start time.

4. Memory Unit Extraction:
   - Decompose complex utterances into minimal, indivisible factual statements.

INPUT DIALOGUE:
{dialogue_window}

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "memory_units": [
    {
      "content": "Alice agreed to meet Bob at the Starbucks on 5th Avenue on 2025-11-20T14
          :00:00.",
      "entities": ["Alice", "Bob", "Starbucks", "5th Avenue"],
      "topic": "Meeting Planning",
      "timestamp": "2025-11-20T14:00:00",
      "salience": "high"
    }
  ]
}


A.2. Stage 2: Adaptive Retrieval Planning Prompt
This prompt analyzes the user query prior to retrieval. Its purpose is to estimate query complexity and generate a structured
retrieval plan that adapts retrieval scope accordingly.
                             Listing 2. Prompt for Query Analysis and Adaptive Retrieval Planning.
Analyze the following user query and generate a retrieval plan. Your objective is to
    retrieve sufficient information while minimizing unnecessary context usage.

                                                              11
                                  SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents


USER QUERY:
{user_query}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Query Complexity Estimation:
   - Assign "LOW" if the query can be answered via direct fact lookup or a single memory
       unit.
   - Assign "HIGH" if the query requires aggregation across multiple events, temporal
       comparison, or synthesis of patterns.

2. Retrieval Signals:
   - Lexical layer: extract exact keywords or entity names.
   - Temporal layer: infer absolute time ranges if relevant.
   - Semantic layer: rewrite the query into a declarative form suitable for semantic
       matching.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "complexity": "HIGH",
  "retrieval_rationale": "The query requires reasoning over multiple temporally separated
       events.",
  "lexical_keywords": ["Starbucks", "Bob"],
  "temporal_constraints": {
     "start": "2025-11-01T00:00:00",
     "end": "2025-11-30T23:59:59"
  },
  "semantic_query": "The user is asking about the scheduled meeting with Bob, including
       location and time."
}


A.3. Stage 3: Reconstructive Synthesis Prompt
This prompt guides the final answer generation using retrieved memory. It combines high-level abstract representations with
fine-grained factual details to produce a grounded response.

                              Listing 3. Prompt for Reconstructive Synthesis (Answer Generation).
You are an assistant with access to a structured long-term memory.

USER QUERY:
{user_query}

RETRIEVED MEMORY (Ordered by Relevance):

[ABSTRACT REPRESENTATIONS]:
{retrieved_abstracts}

[DETAILED MEMORY UNITS]:
{retrieved_units}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Hierarchical Reasoning:
   - Use abstract representations to capture recurring patterns or general user
       preferences.
   - Use detailed memory units to ground the response with specific facts.

2. Conflict Handling:
   - If inconsistencies arise, prioritize the most recent memory unit.
   - Optionally reference abstract patterns when relevant.

3. Temporal Consistency:
   - Ensure all statements respect the timestamps provided in memory.


                                                              12
                                  SimpleMem: Efficient Lifelong Memory for LLM Agents

4. Faithfulness:
   - Base the answer strictly on the retrieved memory.
   - If required information is missing, respond with: "I do not have enough information
       in my memory."

FINAL ANSWER:


A.4. LongMemEval Evaluation Prompt
For the LongMemEval benchmark, we employed gpt-4.1-mini as the judge to evaluate the correctness of the agent’s
responses. The prompt strictly instructs the judge to focus on semantic and temporal consistency rather than exact string
matching. The specific prompt template used is provided below:

                                        Listing 4. LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Prompt.
Your task is to label an answer to a question as ’CORRECT’ or ’WRONG’.
You will be given the following data:
    (1) a question (posed by one user to another user),
    (2) a ’gold’ (ground truth) answer,
    (3) a generated answer
which you will score as CORRECT/WRONG.

The point of the question is to ask about something one user should know about the other
    user based on their prior conversations.
The gold answer will usually be a concise and short answer that includes the referenced
    topic, for example:
Question: Do you remember what I got the last time I went to Hawaii?
Gold answer: A shell necklace

The generated answer might be much longer, but you should be generous with your grading -
    as long as it touches on the same topic as the gold answer, it should be counted as
    CORRECT.

For time related questions, the gold answer will be a specific date, month, year, etc. The
     generated answer might be much longer or use relative time references (like "last
    Tuesday" or "next month"), but you should be generous with your grading - as long as
    it refers to the same date or time period as the gold answer, it should be counted as
    CORRECT. Even if the format differs (e.g., "May 7th" vs "7 May"), consider it CORRECT
    if it’s the same date.

Now it’s time for the real question:
Question: {question}
Gold answer: {gold_answer}
Generated answer: {generated_answer}

First, provide a short (one sentence) explanation of your reasoning, then finish with
    CORRECT or WRONG.
Do NOT include both CORRECT and WRONG in your response, or it will break the evaluation
    script.

Just return the label CORRECT or WRONG in a json format with the key as "label".



B. Extended Implementation Details and Experiments
B.1. Dataset Description
LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024) is specifically designed to test the limits of LLMs in processing long-term conversational
dependencies. The dataset comprises conversation samples ranging from 200 to 400 turns, containing complex temporal
shifts and interleaved topics. The evaluation set consists of 1,986 questions categorized into four distinct reasoning types:
(1) Multi-Hop Reasoning: Questions requiring the synthesis of information from multiple disjoint turns (e.g., “Based on
what X said last week and Y said today...”); (2) Temporal Reasoning: Questions testing the model’s

General knowledge questions grounded in the conversation context; (4) Single Hop: Direct retrieval tasks requiring exact
matching of specific facts.
LongMemEval-S benchmark. The defining characteristic of this dataset is its extreme context length, which poses a unique
and severe challenge for memory systems. Unlike standard benchmarks, LongMemEval-S requires the system to precisely
locate specific answers across various sub-categories (e.g., temporal events, user preferences) within an exceptionally long
interaction history. This massive search space significantly escalates the difficulty of retrieval and localization, serving as a
rigorous stress test for the system’s precision. We utilized an LLM-as-a-judge protocol (using gpt-4.1-mini) to score
the correctness of generated answers against ground-truth references, categorizing responses as either C ORRECT or W RONG
based on semantic and temporal alignment. The full evaluation prompt is provided in Appendix A.4.

B.2. Hyperparameter Configuration
Table 7 summarizes the hyperparameters used to obtain the results reported in Section 3. These values were selected to
balance memory compactness and retrieval recall, with particular attention to the thresholds governing semantic structured
compression and recursive consolidation.

B.3. Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis
To assess the effectiveness of semantic structured compression and to motivate the design of adaptive retrieval, we analyze
system sensitivity to the number of retrieved memory entries (k). We vary k from 1 to 20 and report the average F1 score on
the LoCoMo benchmark using the GPT-4.1-mini backend.
Table 6 provides two key observations. First, rapid perfor-
mance saturation is observed at low retrieval depth. SimpleMem         Table 6. Performance sensitivity to retrieval count (k). Simple-

often sufficient to answer a query without aggregating many
fragments.                                                                                        Top-k Retrieved Entries
                                                                         Method
                                                                                          k=1      k=3     k=5     k=10 k=20
Second, robustness to increased retrieval depth distinguishes
