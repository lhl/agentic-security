consistency across both turns, suggesting its stable
performance throughout all experiments. While
Mistral model tend to be less stable as it included
attributes that are not in the dialogue. A hallucina-
tion evaluation conducted using DeepEval yielded
a score of 99.14%, indicating strong factual consis-
tency. Table 12 presents examples of annotations
with lower scores. While these annotations are
more generic or abstract, they remain semantically
aligned with the original input.

   Question Augmentation
   Given the following question, determine what are the main inquiry attribute to look for and the person the question is for.
   Respond in the format: Person:[names]Attributes:[].
   Basic Augmentation
   You are an expert annotator who generates the most relevant attributes in a conversation. Given the conversation below,
   identify the key attributes and their values on a turn by turn level.
   Attributes should be specific with most relevant values only. Don’t include speaker name. Include value information
   that you find relevant and their names if mentioned. Each dialogue turn contains a dialogue id between [ ]. Make sure
   to include the dialogue the attributes and values are extracted form. Important: Respond only in the format [{speaker
   name:[Dialog id]:[attribute]<value>}].
   Dialogue Turn:{}
   Priority Augmentation
   You are an expert dialogue annotator, given the following dialogue turn generate a list of attributes and values for relevant
   information in the text.
   Generate the annotations in the format: [attribute]<value>where attribute is the attribute name and value is its corre-
   sponding value from the text.
   and values for relevant information in this dialogue turn with respect to each person. Be concise and direct.
   Include person name as an attribute and value pair.
   Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully.
   1- Identify the key attributes in the dialogue turn and their corresponding values.
   2- Arrange attributes descendingly with respect to relevance from left to right.
   3- Generate the sorted annotations list in the format: [attribute]<value>where attribute is the attribute name and value is
   its corresponding value from the text.
   4- Skip all attributes with none vales
   Important: YOU MUST put attribute name is between [ ] and value between <>. Only return a list of [at-
   tribute]<value>nothing else. Dialogue Turn: {}

Table 8: Prompts used in Question Answering for generating augmentations for questions. Also, augmentations for
conversations, utilizing both basic and priority augmentations.

   Basic Augmentation
   For the following movie identify the most important attributes independently. Determine all attributes that describe the
   movie based on your knowledge of this movie. Choose attribute names that are common characteristics of movies in
   general. Respond in the following format: [attribute]<value of attribute>. The Movie is: {}

   Priority Augmentation
   You are a movie annotation expert tasked with analyzing movies and generating key-attribute pairs. For the following
   movie identify the most important. Determine all attribute that describe the movie based on your knowledge of this
   movie. Choose attribute names that are common characteristics of movies in general. Respond in the following format:
   [attribute]<value of attribute>. Sort attributes from left to right based on their relevance. The Movie is:{}
   Dialogue Augmentation
   Identify the key attributes that best describe the movie the user wants for recommendation in the dialogue. These
   attributes should encompass movie features that are relevant to the user sorted descendingly with respect to user interest.
   Respond in the format: [attribute]<value>.

Table 9: Prompts used in Conversational Recommendation for recommending Movies utilizing both basic and
priority augmentations.

   Dialogue Augmentation
   Given the following attributes and values that annotate a dialogue for every speaker in the format [attribute]<value>,
   generate a summary for the event attributes only to describe the main and important events represented in these
   annotations. Refrain from mentioning any minimal event. Include any event-related details and speaker. Format: a bullet
   paragraph for major life events for every speaker with no special characters. Don’t include anything else in your response
   or extra text or lines. Don’t include bullets. Input annotations: {}
