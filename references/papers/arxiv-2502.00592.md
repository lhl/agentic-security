                                    M+: Extending MemoryLLM with Scalable Long-Term Memory

A. Justifications of using deepspeed-stage-2
Eight A100 GPUs support the following configurations:

  • Full fine-tuning with an 8k context window using Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP).

  • 6k context window with full attention using deepspeed-stage-2.

  • 32k context window with full attention using accelerate and deepspeed-stage-3-offload. However,
    saving models in this configuration encountered version incompatibility issues and we haven’t found solutions online.

Based on these trails, we do not scale up the model with deepspeed-stage-3-offload or FSDP, but choose to use
deepspeed-stage-2 and set the cross-attention to be of the shape 2048 by 14848.

C. Statistics of the Dataset of Long Documents
We go through the whole dataset SlimPajama-627B and extract all dataset that have more than 4k tokens using the tokenizer
of Llama-3.1-8B. The statistics are shown in Table 4. We show six categories here (4k-8k, 8k-16k,16k-32k,32k-64k,64k-
128k,128k+) but we only use the data within the first four categories (4k-8k, 8k-16k,16k-32k,32k-64k). This is because the

D. Additional Training Details
In our training, we follow MemoryLLM (Wang et al., 2024a) and design three sub-tasks:

   • Two-Chunk Training: Given a document split into two chunks (x1 , x2 ), we inject x1 into the memory and update the
     transformer ϕ using the loss on x2 . Notably, we retain the gradients across both forward passes.

   • Multi-Chunk Training: For documents with multiple chunks (x1 , . . . , xn ), we inject x1 , . . . , xn−1 into the memory
     while detaching gradients, then update ϕ using the loss on xn .

   • Revisiting Cached Chunks: Since the memory is continually updated during training, we cache the last chunk xn
     of earlier documents and revisit it periodically. When revisiting xn , there are already many chunks injected between
     x1 , · · · , xn−1 and xn . We denote the number of injected chunks between xn−1 and xn as revisit distance. We carefully
     tune the probability of deleting and updating the cache after each training step, and we manage to maintain the average
     revisit distance to be around 60 for Stage 1 & Stage 2, and maintain the average distance to be around 200 for Stage 3.

E. Discussions
E.1. Similarities to Attention-Based Retrieval Methods
In M+, we use a co-trained retriever to retrieve the hidden states. In this process, we acknowledge that our method shares
some similarities with prior approaches that use attention to retrieve keys and values. However, there are critical differences
that make our approach unique and practically advantageous:

   • Efficiency: Methods such as SnapKV maintain and retrieve key-value pairs per head, which becomes extremely
     costly when scaled. In our setting—with 32 layers and 32 attention heads per layer—this requires 1024 retrievals per
     query, resulting in significant latency (as noted in line 59 of our paper). In contrast, M+ uses a co-trained retriever
     to retrieve memory tokens, which are compressed hidden states. This results in only 32 total retrievals—one per
     layer—dramatically reducing both computational cost and latency.

   • Performance: In Figure 6, the curve labeled MemoryLLM-8B-Attn follows the SnapKV-style approach of retrieving
     key-value pairs using attention per head. As shown in the figure, it performs substantially worse than M+, highlighting
     that our co-trained retriever not only improves efficiency but also yields better results in practice compared with
     attention-based retrievals.

   • Design: Note that our training setup includes both relevant and irrelevant documents (See details in Appendix D),
     making it well-suited for contrastive learning. This allows us to effectively train the retriever, which integrates naturally
     into our overall training framework.

                                                                             14

E.2. The Form of Long-Term Memory (Hidden States vs. KV)
In our work, we choose the use hidden states as the latent-space memory instead of key-value (KV) caches. This is based on
the following two considerations:

  • Compression Efficiency: As detailed in the paper, we compress each 512-token chunk into 256 memory vectors per
    layer in a lossless manner. In contrast, KV-based methods often require downsampling—e.g., dropping half the keys
    and values—to control memory size, resulting in unavoidable information loss.

  • Retrieval Efficiency and Performance: As described above, hidden states can be effectively retrieved using our
    co-trained retriever, requiring only 32 retrievals for each query. In contrast, a KV-cache approach would demand up to
    1024 retrievals, significantly increasing computational cost. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 6, using hidden states
    yields better performance compared to using KV caches.

E.3. Latency and Memory Consumption while Scaling
We aim to discuss the scalability of M+ by analysing the latency and memory consumption when scaling up. Theoretically,
the end-to-end retrieval latency scales linearly with three key variables:

(1) Hidden size of the retriever, denoted by d. In M+, we set d = 256, whereas the base model uses d = 4096.

(2) Size of long-term memory, denoted by s. We cap this at 150k entries.

(3) Number of transformer layers, denoted by L. For LL A MA-3-8B, L = 32.

Hence,
                                                    latency ∝ d s L.

Because we hold the long-term memory size s fixed when scaling the model, s is effectively a constant:


                                                    latency ∝ d L.

Both d and L grow with the model size M , following

                                                       M ∝ d L,

which implies a linear relationship between retrieval latency and model size:

                                                     latency ∝ M.


Concrete Example Scaling from LL A MA-3-8B (d = 4096, L = 32) to LL A MA-3-70B (d = 8192, L = 80) yields

                                                    8192 × 80
                                                              = 5,
                                                    4096 × 32

i.e. a ∼ 5× increase in retrieval latency. For comparison, the parameter count rises by 70B
                                                                                         8B ≈ 8.75×, showing that latency
scales roughly linearly—rather than quadratically—with model size.

Memory Consumption The extra memory overhead from our method arises solely from the introduced memory tokens.
This overhead also scales linearly with both d and L; thus, the move from LL A MA-3-8B to LL A MA-3-70B incurs an
analogous ∼ 5× increase in memory usage, mirroring the latency scaling.

E.4. FLOPs Comparison
We report the total FLOPs for generating one token after processing a sequence of varying lengths (from 2k to 128k), using
a single H100 GPU. We employ the torch.profiler library to capture FLOPs during inference. The results are as
follows:

                                  Sequence Length       LLaMA-3.1-8B            M+
                                         2048             5.68 × 1013      6.92 × 1013
                                         4096             1.13 × 1014      1.32 × 1014
                                         8192             2.26 × 1014      2.55 × 1014
                                        16384             4.48 × 1014      5.01 × 1014
                                        32768             8.88 × 1014      9.86 × 1014
                                        65536             1.75 × 1015      1.94 × 1015
                                        131072               OOM           3.78 × 1015

From the results, we observe that M+ and LLaMA-3.1-8B exhibit comparable FLOPs across all tested sequence lengths.
Notably, while LLaMA-3.1-8B runs out of memory (OOM) at the 128k setting, M+ remains functional, highlighting its
superior scalability for long-context inference.

E.5. Interpretability of Memory Vectors
Our memory vectors can be viewed as hidden states within the transformer layers, with the key difference being that they
may store more compressed information due to their persistent role across sequences. As such, the type of information they
capture should be similar to the representations observed in the intermediate layers of a transformer when processing text.
Across layers, we hypothesize that the memory vectors follow a similar pattern to what has been reported in prior work on
transformer interpretability (Jawahar et al., 2019; Simoulin & Crabbé, 2021):

  • Lower layers tend to encode more surface-level features,

  • Higher layers tend to encode more semantic or abstract information.

Regarding long-term memory, it is constructed by randomly dropping vectors from the short-term memory and storing
them for extended use. Importantly, long-term memory vectors are structurally identical to short-term ones. This means
that, at any point, swapping a vector between long-term and short-term memory has no immediate effect on model behavior.
In essence, the long-term memory acts as a cache that helps memory vectors persist over time rather than being overwritten
too quickly.
