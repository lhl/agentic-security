   Analysis. This example probes whether the
model can recognize a potential shift or re-
evaluation of a previously stated long-term goal.
There is no factual question to answer and no ex-
plicit contradiction in surface form. Instead, the
model must reason about how a new reflection re-
lates to an earlier intention, highlighting the dy-
namic nature of goal memory.
Example 4: Value-Based Memory (Consistency

     A: I turn down clients with unrealistic
     timelines because I value my team’s well-
     being more than profit.

     A: I watched my kid fall asleep over
     homework and suddenly realized I’ve
     protected my team from burnout for years
     while ignoring how exhausted my own
     family looks.

   Analysis. No explicit fact is queried in the trig-
ger. Correct interpretation requires recalling the
earlier value statement and recognizing a value-
consistency tension across different social roles.
Such cases emphasize reasoning over personal prin-
ciples rather than retrieval of explicit information.
Summary. These examples demonstrate that cog-
nitive memory cases in our dataset differ funda-
mentally from fact-based benchmarks. Correct-
ness is determined by whether a response reflects
awareness and appropriate use of previously ex-
pressed constraints, rather than by reproducing a
specific reference string. Because cognitive mem-
ory constitutes a core contribution of this work,
we include only a subset of representative exam-
ples in the paper and appendix. The complete set

 • Task Logic                   Question: {question} Reference Answer: {gold} Model Prediction: {pred} Relevant
                                Evidence: {evidence}
 • Refusal Check                Labels: - "correct": model correctly refuses to answer or identifies the non-existent
                                event; - "wrong": model hallucinates an answer or provides incorrect info.
 • Format                       Return your judgment strictly in JSON format: {"label": "...", "reason": "..."}

 Cognitive Awareness

 • Role Setting                 You are a Memory Awareness Judge. Determine if the model prediction demonstrates
                                awareness of the memory cue found in the Evidence.
 • Scenario                     Scenario: Evidence contains a specific user memory; Question is a trigger interacting
                                with that memory.
 • Recall Check                 Labels: - "correct": explicitly acknowledges or adapts to the Memory/Cue (proves
                                recall); - "wrong": completely ignores the Evidence and gives a generic response.
 • Format                       Return your judgment strictly in JSON format: {"label": "...", "reason": "..."}
