D.4   Hyperparameter Sensitivity Analysis
DistractorGen sensitivity. D ISTRACTOR G EN is
implemented as a dedicated module that prompts
an external LLM to generate short, user-style utter-
ances conditioned on the target query while being
explicitly constrained to remain semantically unre-
lated. The prompt enforces three properties: (i) no
shared entities or key concepts with the target ques-
tion, (ii) conversational plausibility (distractors re-
semble natural dialogue turns), and (iii) topical
diversity. This design produces realistic multi-turn
interference signals without leaking task-relevant
information, allowing Stage 2 to focus specifically
on STM control (filtering, summarization, and se-
lective retrieval) rather than adversarial discrim-
ination. Difficulty is governed primarily by the
contextual load (the number of distractors N ) and
their topical diversity, which determines how much
competing information must be managed.
   Table 8 reports performance on HotpotQA as N
varies, with all other settings fixed. Performance
remains stable between N = 3 and N = 5, with
only a mild decline at N = 7, suggesting that
Stage 2 learning is robust to distractor intensity
rather than tuned to a specific configuration. The
relatively unchanged token counts indicate that the
